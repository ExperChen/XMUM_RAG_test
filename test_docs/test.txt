Introduction

As part of our university's community service programme for Semester 1, 2025, our 
group conducted a project titled "Campus Convenience Map & Engagement Campaign", 
which took place throughout March to May 2025. The purpose of this project was to 
raise awareness about various helpful and often overlooked facilities on campus, 
such as shared umbrella stations, charging points, second-hand book corners, and 
more. To increase student engagement, we also designed a simple flying game that 
attracted students to our booth and made the campaign more interactive and 
enjoyable.
